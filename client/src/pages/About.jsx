          <span className="font-semibold">Welcome to Music Player!</span>
          <br /> We were inspired by the sophistication and popularity of music
          services like Spotify in building{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">Music Player</span>. By taking some
          inspiration from already successful concepts, we strive to provide a
          similar experience but with a unique twist and different features. And
          this project was made for our assignment in college.

          We are committed to providing an engaging experience for music lovers,
          but also value our authenticity and unique contribution in creating
